# Lnk2past

Hello! I am Nick, and I am a software engineer and educator. I primarily teach courses in scientific computing and data visualization.

Recently I have been focused largely on writing and improving tools I use for my classes. I also ~~don't~~ maintain my blog over at [NESWare.io](https://www.nesware.io/), so check it out if you want. Or don't, I have maybe half a dozen unfinished articles because I am undecisive.

I am interested in collaborating on anything dealing with simulations, dataviz, or education tools.

Thanks for stopping by!
